# TailwindCSS-OffLine
All the Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 basic classes in one css file to work offline
 
Added the prefixes: 
<br /><br />
sm: <br />
md: <br />
lg: <br />
xl: <br />
2xl: <br />
hover: <br />
focus: <br />
active:<br />
<br /> 

## How?
Simple, link the css in your web file

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="all-tailwind-classes-full-min.css">`

Then use Tailwind classes in your html code

`<div class="p-5 m-auto mt-10 w-52 rounded-md text-center font-bold cursor-pointer text-white hover:text-green-400 bg-blue-500 active:bg-yellow-500 sm:bg-fuchsia-500">Hi there!</div>`

<br />

## About
Tailwind is a great idea but I usually work with the basic classes in my web little projects.
Due to my geolocation, I do not always have an internet connection and I'm too lazy to configure Node.js every time I start a small web project.
